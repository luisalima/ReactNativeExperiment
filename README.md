# React native experiments...

This is just a repo for doing some experiments of what it is possible to do with RN. Built as a series of experiments, for internal consumption only, but open to the public in case it ends up being useful for someone.

Here are the questions to answer, more or less in order...

* [x] What can we do with **text**?
* [x] How can we make a **button** that has an appropriate mobile feel?
* [x] How do we make **navigation** work with proper transitions?
* [x] How do we make a custom **navbar**?
* [x] What is the best way to integrate **icons** into a RN app?
* [ ] How can we build a **tabbed menu**?
* [ ] How can we create a **slider menu** (the infamous hamburguer menu) -- even in iOS?
* [ ] What can we do with **images**?
* [ ] How do we customize **lists** (`ListView`) -- both items and the overall list look?
* [ ] What kind of form components can we use, and how can we customize them?
* [ ] What are the best practices for form validation?
* [ ] How can we create **swipe** actions on list items?
* [ ] What kind of **animations** can we trigger and how?

In summary, this repo aims to answer the question of how to customize RN elements as much as possible from a styling perspective.
